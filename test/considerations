To ensure a candidate is fully prepared to perform a real-world simulated attack, especially within the banking industry, you should evaluate their skills through a variety of targeted tests and assessments. The following tests and evaluations will help confirm their readiness and competence:
1. Technical Skills and Knowledge
1.1 Penetration Testing Fundamentals

    Test: Evaluate the candidate's understanding of penetration testing methodologies, such as OWASP testing guidelines, PTES, and NIST standards.
    Assessment: Conduct a theoretical exam or a practical scenario that requires the candidate to outline the steps they would take in a typical penetration test for a banking application.

1.2 Vulnerability Assessment

    Test: Test the candidate’s ability to identify and assess common vulnerabilities in banking applications, such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and sensitive data exposure.
    Assessment: Provide a vulnerable banking application or simulated environment and ask the candidate to perform a vulnerability assessment, reporting their findings and suggesting mitigations.

2. Real-World Scenario Simulations
2.1 Phishing Simulation

    Test: Assess the candidate's ability to design and execute phishing attacks ethically within a controlled environment.
    Assessment: Create a simulated phishing exercise where the candidate must identify phishing vectors and suggest countermeasures, without actually performing the attack on real users.

2.2 Social Engineering

    Test: Evaluate the candidate's knowledge of social engineering techniques and how to recognize and mitigate such attacks.
    Assessment: Provide a case study or scenario where the candidate must outline how they would handle social engineering attempts and protect sensitive information.

3. Technical Proficiency with Financial Systems
3.1 Secure Coding Practices

    Test: Assess the candidate's knowledge of secure coding practices relevant to banking applications.
    Assessment: Review a piece of code for security vulnerabilities, or provide a coding challenge that requires the candidate to implement secure practices in a banking application context.

3.2 API Security

    Test: Evaluate the candidate’s understanding of API security, focusing on issues like authentication, authorization, and data protection.
    Assessment: Provide a banking API and ask the candidate to perform a security assessment, identifying weaknesses and suggesting improvements.

4. Compliance and Regulatory Knowledge
4.1 Industry Regulations

    Test: Test the candidate’s knowledge of industry-specific regulations and compliance requirements, such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, and SOX.
    Assessment: Provide a scenario where the candidate must ensure that a banking application or system complies with relevant regulations and outline steps for compliance.

4.2 Data Protection

    Test: Assess the candidate's ability to handle sensitive data securely.
    Assessment: Evaluate their understanding of data encryption, secure data storage, and data breach response in a banking context.

5. Advanced Attack Simulations
5.1 Red Team Exercise

    Test: Conduct a red team exercise where the candidate simulates a sophisticated attack on a banking environment.
    Assessment: Evaluate the candidate’s ability to plan and execute an attack strategy, including advanced techniques like lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence.

5.2 Incident Response

    Test: Assess the candidate’s knowledge of incident response procedures.
    Assessment: Provide a simulated security incident and evaluate how the candidate handles the situation, including detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.

6. Soft Skills and Communication
6.1 Reporting and Documentation

    Test: Evaluate the candidate’s ability to document their findings and communicate effectively.
    Assessment: Review a sample report created by the candidate, focusing on clarity, detail, and actionable recommendations.

6.2 Team Collaboration

    Test: Assess the candidate’s ability to work as part of a security team.
    Assessment: Conduct a collaborative exercise or role-play scenario where the candidate must coordinate with other team members and stakeholders.

7. Ethical and Legal Considerations
7.1 Ethical Hacking Knowledge

    Test: Test the candidate’s understanding of ethical hacking principles and legal considerations.
    Assessment: Provide hypothetical scenarios involving legal and ethical dilemmas and assess how the candidate would handle these situations.

7.2 Compliance with Legal Boundaries

    Test: Assess the candidate’s understanding of legal boundaries related to penetration testing and security assessments.
    Assessment: Discuss scenarios where legal boundaries might be tested and evaluate the candidate’s approach to ensuring compliance.

Summary

To ensure the candidate is ready for a real-world simulated attack in the banking industry, you should:

    Test Technical Skills: Evaluate their fundamental knowledge and technical proficiency with banking systems.
    Simulate Real-World Scenarios: Assess their ability to perform and handle attacks in controlled environments.
    Assess Compliance Knowledge: Ensure they understand industry regulations and data protection requirements.
    Evaluate Advanced Skills: Test their ability to handle advanced attack simulations and incident responses.
    Check Soft Skills: Review their communication, documentation, and collaboration abilities.
    Ensure Ethical and Legal Awareness: Confirm their understanding of ethical practices and legal boundaries.
