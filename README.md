GitHub and AWS Secrets Detection Script

This script is designed to simulate the detection and exploitation of secrets (e.g., AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, API keys) found in files within a GitHub repository. It showcases basic techniques used in penetration testing and security assessments.
Features:

    Fetches files from a GitHub repository.
    Searches for secrets in specified files using regex patterns.
    Simulates exploitation of found secrets (e.g., accessing S3 buckets, using GitHub tokens).
    Implements logging and error handling.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

    Python 3.x: The script is compatible with Python 3.x.
    Required Python Libraries: The script uses several Python libraries that need to be installed.

Setup Instructions
  Clone the Repository
    If you have a repository URL, you can clone it using Git: 
        
            git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git cd your-repo-directory

Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip. You can do this by running:

bash :

      pip install requests boto3 PyGithub

Configure Environment Variables

Set up the required environment variables for GitHub and AWS:

GitHub Token: Set the GitHub token as an environment variable. This token is needed to access private repositories.

      export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token_here'

AWS Region (optional): If you need to use a region other than us-west-2, set the AWS region as an environment variable:

bash:

    export AWS_REGION='your_aws_region_here'

Prepare Your Configuration

Update the script with the following details:

    REPO_URL: The URL of the GitHub repository you want to scan.
    TARGET_FILE_PATH: The path to the file within the repository where secrets are expected to be found.

The default values in the script are:

python

    REPO_URL = 'https://api.github.com/repos/myorg/myrepo'
    TARGET_FILE_PATH = 'config/.env'

    Update these values as needed based on your target repository and file path.

Expected Inputs

When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter:

    GitHub Repository URL: Provide the URL of the GitHub repository you want to scan. Example: https://api.github.com/repos/myorg/myrepo.
    File Path: Enter the path to the file where secrets are expected to be found. Example: config/.env.

Running the Script

Run the script from the command line:


python secrets_detection_script.py

You will be prompted to enter the GitHub repository URL and the file path where secrets are expected to be found.
Configuration Details

    Secrets Detection: The script looks for the following keywords in the specified files: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, GITHUB_TOKEN, and API_KEY.
    Bucket Name: Currently hardcoded as 'example-bucket'. Update this to use a dynamic approach if needed.
    Rate Limiting: The script handles GitHub API rate limits with retry logic.

Logging

The script uses Python’s logging module to log information, warnings, and errors. Logs will be printed to the console. Modify the logging configuration in the script to save logs to a file or adjust the logging level if needed.
Ethical Considerations

Disclaimer: This script is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal. Always conduct penetration testing within legal and ethical boundaries.
Troubleshooting

    Missing Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
    Invalid Token or Credentials: Verify that the environment variables are correctly set and that your tokens or credentials are valid.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step CLI instructive for deploying and evaluating a script that simulates a real-world attack scenario. This guide assumes the script is designed to detect and exploit secrets from a GitHub repository, as discussed previously.
Step-by-Step CLI Instructive for Deploying the Penetration Testing Script
**1. Preparation

    Ensure Dependencies Are Installed:
        Verify that Python and required libraries are installed. You will need requests, boto3, github, and getpass.
        Install dependencies if they are not already available:

        bash

        pip install requests boto3 github

    Prepare the Environment:
        Ensure you have access to the GitHub repository and AWS environment.
        Obtain necessary credentials and tokens:
            GitHub Token: Generate a personal access token from GitHub with appropriate scopes.
            AWS Credentials: Ensure you have AWS IAM credentials with necessary permissions.

**2. Configure the Script

    Set Environment Variables (Recommended for Security):
        Store sensitive credentials in environment variables to avoid hardcoding them in the script.

        bash

        export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key_id_here"
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_access_key_here"

    Edit the Script Configuration:
        Ensure the script configuration is correctly set. Open the script file and review or update the following parameters:
            REPO_URL: URL of the GitHub repository.
            TARGET_FILE_PATH: Path to the file you want to search for secrets.
            AWS_REGION: AWS region for accessing resources.
            Ensure no hardcoded sensitive information is present.

**3. Run the Script

    Execute the Script:
        Run the script from the command line. Ensure you are in the same directory as the script or provide the full path.

        bash

        python path/to/your_script.py

    Provide Inputs:
        The script will prompt you for inputs. Provide the required information as prompted:
            GitHub Repository URL: Enter the URL of the GitHub repository.
            File Path: Enter the path to the file where secrets might be found (e.g., config/.env).

**4. Monitor Execution

    Check for Output and Logs:
        Monitor the command line output for status updates and results. The script should print findings and any errors encountered.
        Check if the script successfully fetches files, detects secrets, and attempts exploitation based on the detected secrets.

    Handle Errors:
        If errors occur, review the error messages. Common issues might include invalid tokens, missing files, or API rate limits.

**5. Review Results

    Analyze Output:
        Examine the output for details on detected secrets and any attempted exploitation. Ensure the findings are accurate and relevant.
        Confirm that the script’s actions align with the defined scope and objectives.

    Validate Exploitation:
        If the script performed exploitation actions (e.g., accessed S3 buckets or used GitHub tokens), verify that these actions were successful and demonstrate the potential impact.

**6. Generate Report

    Prepare Report:
        Document the findings in a detailed report, including:
            Secrets Detected: List of all identified secrets.
            Actions Taken: Description of exploitation attempts and their outcomes.
            Recommendations: Suggested remediation for any vulnerabilities found.

    Review and Finalize:
        Ensure the report is clear, actionable, and maintains ethical standards.
        Review the report with relevant stakeholders and provide recommendations for improving security.

**7. Post-Deployment Actions

    Clean Up:
        Ensure all temporary files or logs are securely deleted or handled according to your organization’s policies.
        Remove any environment variables used for sensitive data:

        bash

        unset GITHUB_TOKEN
        unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

    Feedback and Iteration:
        Review feedback on the script’s performance and make necessary improvements.
        Update the script based on any new vulnerabilities or changes in best practices.

**8. Ethical Considerations

    Adhere to Ethical Guidelines:
        Ensure that all actions performed with the script are within the authorized scope and comply with ethical standards.
        Avoid any unauthorized access, data modification, or actions outside the agreed boundaries.

By following these steps, you can effectively deploy and evaluate a penetration testing script while ensuring that it operates within the defined scope and adheres to ethical guidelines. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the script's performance and its alignment with real-world attack scenarios.
